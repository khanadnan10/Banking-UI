# Banking UI

The app has a clean and modern look, with a combination of white, teal, peach, and yello colours. The home screen displays the user's account balance in large, bold text, along with money transferred, month overview and recent transactions categories. 

The 'see all' gesture detector on the recent transaction of the screen linked to other page in the app, showing expenses. The top of the drawer features the user's profile picture, as well as a button to notification details.
